# Project management

Our project is based on an actual prototype application which uses indoor position system called "KANA". The most difficult part in this project is the brainstorming, coming up with new ideas to provide better solutions for the outdated prototype. Another difficulty in the documentation process is the thinking of how to divide the main modules and represent their functions, due to the lack of experience, the final outcome may not be an ideal model for a practical application. Perhaps in time, we will be able to create better and more logical model.

We ourselves find it quite easy to divide the workload, in which everyone will do some parts on his/her own and some parts we will do together. We have some difficulties in finding times to work together due to our different timetables, somehow we managed to solve that issue by working after school time. We usually communicate with each other through Facebook and email to update and keep the project going. We were a great team and I hope we can work together in the next project.

* Estimation working hours: in average, each team member spent about 15 hours.
* Reality: in average, each team member spent about 12 hours.

The different between the estimation and reality is not too significant, and in fact we spent less than expected, so it can be said that we have done a good job in planning and dividing work load. The project is also a success in terms of brainstorming as we bred new ideas and profoundly believed that it will be a game changer, if the product is ever made, we would probably buy and use it (unless it is free!).

Perhaps what we are not really content with is the number of use cases, which should be huge, but due to the nature of the report, we decided to list only a handful of most important use cases, so not all are listed in the report.
